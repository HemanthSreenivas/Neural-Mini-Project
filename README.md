# Neural-Mini-Project
 This project integrates neural networks into small games to enhance gameplay through advanced decision-making and dynamic challenge adaptation. Using PyTorch, the neural networks employ reinforcement learning to analyze player behavior and modify strategies in real time. A Python-based visualization tool, built with Matplotlib, illustrates training progress, loss metrics, and decision pathways. Players can interactively see the impact of their actions on the networkâ€™s learning, deepening their understanding of machine learning concepts. The modular architecture allows for easy integration of additional games and models, using technologies like Python, Pygame, and Matplotlib to explore the intersection of gaming and AI.
